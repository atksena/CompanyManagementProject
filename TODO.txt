TODO's:

* `docker compose up` ve `docker compose down` komutlarını detaylıca araştır
* İşletim sistemine yeni bir şey kurma.
* Understand DRF(Django REST Framework)
* Develop Backend Login endpoint (api/auth/login/)
  - Use class based ViewSet or APIView instead of function-based views.
* Create Postman collection for the BlabsInternshipProject
* Test the endpoint with Postman
* Develop Login.vue page on frontend
  - Make login page an entirely different page that renders without the rest of the frontend contents.
  - Error messages that come from the backend should be presented to the user properly.
* Connect Login.vue form to backend endpoint

Alternative:
* Install co-pilot for PyCharm


Notes:
* docker compose up
* docker compose down
